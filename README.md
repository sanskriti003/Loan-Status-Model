# Loan-Status-Model
<br>This project summarizes the characteristics of variables that can affect the loan status to get some
ideas about the relationships among multiple variables using summary statistics and data
visualization.</br>
<br>In this project, several data visualization techniques are used to represent and plot the data
graphically including Histograms, scatter plots, heat maps, Color maps, Line Graphs, Tree Maps
and Bar Graphs. All these listed data visualization techniques proved prominently useful to lay a
description of various scenarios the data was used for.</br>
<br>Further, machine learning techniques, like logistic regression, decision tree classifier and random
forest were used to further enhance the information received from the personal loan data and its
visualization.</br>
